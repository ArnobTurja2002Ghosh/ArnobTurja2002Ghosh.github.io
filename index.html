          <p> I am an undergraduate student in the <a href="https://www.mun.ca/computerscience/">Department of Computer Science</a> at the Memorial University of Newfoundland. </p>
          <p> My interest is in data structures and algorithms. </p>
          <p> Check out <A HREF=https://github.com/ArnobTurja2002Ghosh/SetCover>my biggest python project</A> till now, where I tried to implement almost all my concepts about the Tree data structure. 
            It has an exponential runtime but ensures optimal solutions -unlike genetic algorithms for which I prefer java.
            The tree in the project was written from scratch and I am not sure if python offers a built-in tree,
            but there are many built-in data structures that can be used by importing different python libraries.
            One of those libraries is pandas which I use for dataframes and series. A few projects I made using pandas are:
            <ul>
              <li><A HREF=https://github.com/ArnobTurja2002Ghosh/gistemp>gistemp</A> 
                <ul>
                 <li> Visualised data from Nasa to histograms. </li>
                 <li> Used two matplotlib modules for the histograms: 
                  <ul> <li>pyplot (the most common matplotlib module)</li>
                       <li>colors</li>
                  </ul>
                 </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li> <A HREF=https://github.com/ArnobTurja2002Ghosh/Cary>Cary</A>
                <ul>
                  <li> Visualised three datasets about the town of Cary of North Carolina in one notebook.</li>
                  <li> Interestingly noticed that Cary Arts Centre is not counted as a point of interest. Why? </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><A HREF=https://github.com/ArnobTurja2002Ghosh/pca>pca</A>
                <ul>
                    <li> In February 2024, I came across a paper in ReasearchGate <i>Evaluation of Breast Cancer Tumor Classification with Unconstrained Functional Networks Classifier</i> and tried to recreate the Figure 3 and Figure 5. </li>
                    <li> While trying to recreate Figure 3 I discovered that the axes are mislabelled - neither the x-axis represents the Mean Radius, nor does the y-axis represent Mean Texture. 
                        Instead, if I take x-axis to represent mean texture and y-axis to represent mean perimeter, my figure looks the same as their figure-3.</li>
                    <li> When it came to Figure 5, I completely lost what exactly they did with the data. Firstly, smoothness can never be negative. 
                        Secondly, if you look at the data and take a peek of the smoothness columns, smoothness tends to be between 0 and 1.
                        In contrast to them, Figure 5 'worst mean smoothness' has a higher range and can have negative values. 
                        My guess about what they did is that they plotted the scaled values of the smoothness_worst column in the z-axis.
                      <ul>
                        <li>But even with the scaled values, a z-limit of -3 to 4 should be enough. Why did they choose to extend it to -4 to 6?</li>
                        <li>Also, why are x and y axis plotted as original data, but z-axis as scaled data? If one says that it is because smoothness_worst has too low range, I would say that area_worst has too high range.</li>
                      </ul>
                        I am still working on the above questions 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>

          <p> 
            Tabannum and I developed a tic-tac-toe game using the brython library of python. 
            This project is available upon request only, so please feel free to contact any of us. 
            My contact information is at the end of this page.
          </p>

          <p> I have written search algorithms like <a HREF=https://github.com/ArnobTurja2002Ghosh/Search>BFS, DFS,</a> <a HREF=https://github.com/ArnobTurja2002Ghosh/Search2>A*,</a> <a HREF=https://github.com/ArnobTurja2002Ghosh/IDDFS>IDDFS</a> without any use of recursion, using javascript. 
            However, they are just the rough algorithms and cannot be implemented (you cannot simply dowload and run the repositories) since the environment (or map), configuration etc. that these algorithms require as inputs, have not been written by me and so are not there in the repositories.</p>
          <p> If you want to see a javascript project that you can run - or may I say, "play" - <a HREF=https://github.com/zawadman>Zawad Mutawassit</a> and I, in <a HREF=https://github.com/ArnobTurja2002Ghosh/ProjectAI>ProjectAI</a>, developed a game which we informally call "FishFrenz".
            Instructions about how you can interact in the game is provided in the README.
            The game does not contain any GUI: when the game ends, the program crashes, but you can restart the game by simply reloading the browser where you are playing.  
          </p>
          <p>
            FishFrenz story: It is a snowy night. Your enemy - the crocodile - is trying to eat your fish friends.
            The enemy thinks that because it is hard to see in snow, it cannot get shot by you, so it will succeed.
            We know that it is hard to aim at night, let alone in snow, but we still believe in your shooting skill!
          </p> 
          <p> Check out <a href="https://github.com/ArnobTurja2002Ghosh/BouncingShapes">my first C++ project</a>  using SFML and IMGui, inspired from a Youtube tutorial.</p>
          <p>
            Check out my <a href="GArnob/index.html">GArnob</a> Javascript project where a simple concept of Genetic Algorithm (GA) is implemented. 
            This project, unlike the ProjectAI, contains functioning GUI like combo-boxes, buttons and sliders.
            It also implements the highcharts library. To run this project, you do not need to download any of my repositories; 
            click the provided link and you will be directed to the result because, as you know, Javascript can be interpreted by a browser;
            and also, this project would be hardly of any use to you unless you modify it for yourself (or hire me so that I can do something similar for you)
            hence is barely worth occupying the space of your computer.

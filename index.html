          <p>I am an undergraduate student in the <a href="https://www.mun.ca/computerscience/">Department of Computer Science</a> at the Memorial University of Newfoundland. </p>
          <p> I took my IGCSE in June 2019 on 8 subjects, among which my most favourite subject was physics. My most favourite chapter in physics was about current (electricity). </p>
          <p> Yeah! "Bloody Circuits! And just like that I started having an obsession towards a common component of circuits... LIGHT BULBS!!! Nowadays whenever I see light bulbs, I observe different parts of it. 
            Yeah, something as simple as a light bulb has "parts" that make the bulb work! Incase now you are interested, here I have an image of a bulb with its parts labelled by me: </p>
            <img src="pic_bulboff1.gif" alt="Sweet!!" width="200px"> <br>
            <p> Oh, I'm sorry. Is it too dark to see a few parts? Let me brighten it up a bit: </p>
            <img src="pic_bulbon1.gif" alt="Sweet!!" width="170px"> <br>
            <p> Now if you, like me, have got interested about the significance of each part, you can refer to <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescent_light_bulb">this wikipedia article</a>.</p>
            <p> But... "why?" If you still lack the motivation to hop into the wikipedia article and are wondering why you should learn about the parts in details, well... I guess when you will be able to understand the above models, with enough resources, you may be able to make a light bulb yourself!</p>
            <p> Okay, maybe it is a bit late to ask, but what's "light bulb"? </p>
            <p> Hmmm... Good question. In this generation of LED lights, it is okay to not have seen a light bulb in real life at all. But now the pressure is on me. How can I make you understand what a light bulb is, what its functionality looks like etc? Hmmm... Okay, I have an idea. I will let you use my light bulb!

          <p> I am an undergraduate student in the <a href="https://www.mun.ca/computerscience/">Department of Computer Science</a> at the Memorial University of Newfoundland. </p>
          <p> My interest is in data structures and algorithms. </p>
          <p> Check out <A HREF=https://github.com/ArnobTurja2002Ghosh/SetCover>my biggest python project</A> till now, where I tried to implement almost all my concepts about the Tree data structure. 
            It has an exponential runtime but ensures optimal solutions -unlike genetic algorithms for which I prefer java.
            The tree in the project was written from scratch and I am not sure if python offers a built-in tree,
            but there are many built-in data structures that can be used by importing different python libraries.
            One of those libraries is pandas which I use for dataframes and series. A few projects I made using pandas are:
            <ul>
              <li><A HREF=https://github.com/ArnobTurja2002Ghosh/gistemp>gistemp</A> 
                <ul>
                 <li> Visualised data from Nasa to histograms. </li>
                 <li> Used two matplotlib modules for the histograms: 
                  <ul> <li>pyplot (the most common matplotlib module)</li>
                       <li>colors</li>
                  </ul>
                 </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><A HREF=https://github.com/ArnobTurja2002Ghosh/pca>pca</A></li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p> I have written search algorithms like <a HREF=https://github.com/ArnobTurja2002Ghosh/Search>BFS, DFS,</a> <a HREF=https://github.com/ArnobTurja2002Ghosh/Search2>A*,</a> <a HREF=https://github.com/ArnobTurja2002Ghosh/IDDFS>IDDFS</a> without any use of recursion, using javascript. 
            However, they are just the rough algorithms and cannot be implemented (you cannot simply dowload and run the repositories) since the environment (or map), configuration etc. that these algorithms require as inputs, have not been written by me and so are not there in the repositories.</p>

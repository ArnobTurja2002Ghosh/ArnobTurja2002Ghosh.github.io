     "When one is commanded to love with the mind, then not to think
must surely be sin." <BR>
			     - Charles Templeton, ACT OF GOD

     "Success in science depends not only on rational argument but on a
mixture of subterfuge, rhetoric and propaganda." <BR>

THE FOUR STAGES OF PUBLIC OPINION

1.  (Just after publication)
	The Novelty is absurd and subversive of Religion & Morality.
	The propounder is both fool a& knave.

2.  (Twenty years later)
	The Novelty is Absolute Truth and will yield a full and
	satisfactory explanation of things in general - The propounder
	man of sublime genius & perfect virtue.

3.  (Forty years later)
	The Novelty won't explain things in general after all and
	therefore is a wretched failure. The propounder is a very
	ordinary person advertised by a clique.

4.  (A century later)
	The Novelty is a mixture of truth & error. Explains as much as
	could reasonably be expected. The propounder worthy of all
	honour in spite of his share of human frailties, as one who has
	added to the permanent possessions of science.

     "Admire experts for their knowledge and creativity; milk them of
what they can tell you; and pity them for their narrow-mindedness."
<BR>
				- Nigel Calder

     "Well, yes; he could have done all that, but it is not proved: I
am beginning to believe that nothing can ever be proved. These are
honest hypotheses which take the facts into account: but I sense so
definitely that they come from me, and that they are simply a way of
unifying my own knowledge. Not a glimmer comes from Rollebon's side.
Slow, lazy, sulky, the facts adapt themselves to the rigor of the order
I wish to give them; but it remains outside of them. I have the feeling
of doing a work of pure imagination. And I am certain that the
characters in a novel would have a more genuine appearance or, in any
case, would be more agreeable." <BR>
				- Jean-Paul Sartre, NAUSEA.

     "Them funky dinosaurs just done give it up." <BR>
				- James Brown

     "For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over
public relations, for Nature cannot be fooled." <BR>

     " ... great progress ... comes from a satisfactory philosophy
of ignorance ... " <BR>

     "Nature only uses the largest threads to weave her pattern, so
each small piece of the fabric reveals the organization of the entire
tapestry." <BR>

				- Richard P. Feynman

     "Mere power and mere knowledge exalt human nature but do not bless
it. We must gather from the whole store of things such as make most for
the uses of life." <BR>

     "It is not the pleasure of curiousity ... nor the raising of the
spirit, nor the victory of wit, nor lucre of profession, nor ambition of
honor or fame, nor inablement for business, that are the true ends of
knowledge. [Rather it is] a restitution and reinvesting of man to the
sovereignty and power which he had in the first state of creation."
 <BR>
     "There is no Excellent Beauty that hath not some strangeness in
the Proportion." <BR>
				- Francis Bacon

     "I believe that in approaching our subject with the sensibilities
of statisticians and dissectionists, we distance ourselves increasingly
from the marvelous and spell-binding planet of imagination whose gravity
drew us to our studies in the first place. <BR>
     That is not to say that we should cease to establish facts and to
verify our information, but merely to suggest that unless these facts
can be imbued with the flash of poetic insight then they remain dull
gems; semi-precious stones scarcely worth collecting". <BR>
				- Daniel Dreiberg, BLOOD FROM THE
				   SHOULDER OF PALLAS (In Alan
				   Moore, WATCHMEN).

     "If I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!"

     "I think we are well advised to keep on nodding terms with the
people we used to be, whether we find them attractive company or not."
<BR>
				- Joan Didion, "On Keeping a Notebook"

     "Our ability to represent and simulate reality implies that we can
appropriate the order of existence and bring it to serve human purposes.
A good simulation, be it a religious myth or a scientific theory, gives
us a sense of mastery over our experience. To represent something
symbolically, as we do when we speak or write, is somehow to capture it,
thus making it one's own. But with this appropriation comes the
realization that we have denied the immediacy of reality and that in
creating a substitute we have but spun another thread in the web of our
grand illusion." <BR>
				- Heinz Pagels, THE DREAMS OF REASON


     "If thou wilt not fight thy battle of life because in selfishness
thou art afraid of the battle, thy resolution is in vain: nature will
compel thee. <BR>

     Because thou art in the bondage of Karma, of the forces of thine 
own past life; and that which thou, in thy delusion, with a good will 
dost not want to do, unwillingly thou shalt have to do. <BR>

     God dwells in the heart of all things, Arjuna: thy God dwells in
thy heart. And his power of wonder moves all things -- puppets in a play
of shadows -- whirling them onwards on the stream of time. <BR>

     Go to him for thy salvation with all thy soul, victorious man. By
his grace thou shalt obtain the peace supreme, thy home of Eternity.
<BR>

     I have given thee words of vision and wisdom more secret than 
hidden mysteries. Ponder them in the silence of thy soul, and then in
freedom do thy will." <BR>

     O dear children, look in what dungeon we are lying, in what lodging
we are, for we have been captured by the spirit of the outward world; it
is our life, for it nourishes and brings us up, it rules in our marrow 
and bones, in our flesh and blood, it has made our flesh earthly, and 
now death has us. <BR>
				- Jacob Boehme

     We take our first step in words each day, and instantly fall into a
hole in the sounds we make. <BR>

wound of abstraction. <BR>

     I leave to the various futures (not to all) my garden of forking
 paths.

     "How does it sound to you?"
     "Possible, but not interesting," Lo:nnot answered. "You'll reply
that reality hasn't the least obligation to be interesting. And I'll
answer you that reality may avoid this obligation but that hypotheses
may not."
				- Jorge Luis Borges, 
				  "Death and the Compass"

     We ... have dreamt the world. We have dreamt it as firm,
mysterious, visible, ubiquitous in space and durable in time; but in
its architecture we have allowed tenuous and eternal crevices of
unreason which tell us it is false.
				- Jorge Luis Borges, 
				  "Avatars of the Tortise"

     ... the machinery of the world is much too complex for the
simplicity of men

     ... cladistics is merely a method. This is both its strength and
ultimately a source of sterility ...

     I have now conducted you to the doors of nature's house, where its
mysteries lie hidden. If you cannot enter, because the doors are too
narrow, then abstract and contract yourself mathematically into an
atom and you will easily enter, and when you gave come out again, tell
me what miraculous things you saw.
				- Thomas Harriot, in a letter on optics
				   to Johannes Kepler (1606)

     Young man, in mathematics you don't understand things, you get 
used to them.

     The solution looks considerably less elegant than the simple
theoretical correlation which I had originally envisioned, but it has
the indisputable advantage of being correct ...

     In an ultimate sense I cannot know what I do in this place -- yet
I do ultimate things.

     If you have come to help me
     You are wasting your time
     But if you have come because your
     liberation is tied up with mine,
     Then let us work together.
				-Lilla Watson

     How dare you sport thus with life? Do your duty with me, 
     and I will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind. If
     you comply with my condition, I will leave them and you 
     in peace; but if you refuse I will glut the maw of death,
     until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining
     friends.

		HEARTHSIDE

	Half across the world from me
	Lie the lands I'll never see --
	I, whose longing lives and dies
	Where a ship has sailed away;
	I, that never close my eyes
	But to look upon Cathay.

	Things I may not know nor tell
	Wait, where older waters swell;
	Ways that flowered at Sappho's tread,
	Winds that sighed in Homer's strings,
	Vibrant with the singing dead,
	Golden with the dust of wings.

	Under deeper skies than mine,
	Quiet valleys dip and shine.
	Where their tender grasses heal
	Ancient scars of trench and tomb
	I shall never walk; nor kneel
	Where the bones of poets bloom.

	If I seek a lovelier part,
	Where I travel goes my heart;
	Where I stray my thought must go;
	With me wanders my desire.
	Best to sit and watch the snow,
	Turn the lock, and poke the fire.

	Can you hear the silent laughter
	Echo in the whispering celluloid
	Did you long to be with Garbo

	Was it Colbert, Loy, or Harlow
	Did you pine for Norma Jean?
	Monochrome
	Drift to sleep and dream in sepiatone

	Long as you and I are here
	Monochrome
	Boris Karloff shambles from the unknown

	Why do you say there's no color
	Dietrich was the Blue Angel
	Duke and Monty rode Red River

	Fairbanks was a bold Black Pirate
	Cagney's White Heat burned me cold
	There's a panchromatic rainbow

	Let me catch a bus with Gable

	"I remember as a boy reading accounts of `scientific mysteries,'
in the sort of books that have successive chapters on the Loch Ness 
monster, yetis, UFOs, and the Easter Island monuments. ... The emotional
appeal of the more exotic of these mystery accounts is clear: Not only
are such events alluringly weird, but they seem to offer effortless
access to profound and exclusive knowledge. Quickly the reader feels
as though he or she glimpses important truths that the stodgy scientific
world, or conspiratorial governments, have overlooked, misunderstood,
or denied. Accompanyting this feeling of exclusivity may be the
self-rightious satisfaction that comes with disdain for more 
conventional explanations. If others do not share one's own privileged 
viewpoint, then at least, their science must be poor, and at worst, 
perhaps they are aliens themselves."

	"Escaping the dangers of applied science is one thing. Doing the
simple and manifest good which applied science has put in our power is 
another, more difficult, more demanding of human qualities, and in the 
long run far more enriching to us all."


    "It seems to me that engaging in immediate debate on each
     specific point closes one's mind for good and all. Debating
     gives most of us much more psychological satisfaction than
`    thinking does; but it deprives us of whatever chance there
     is of getting closer to the truth. It seems preferable to
     me to sit back and let what has been said sink in -- I don't
     pretend this is altogether easy -- and then, after a longish
     interval, with the advantage of what I've heard and of new
     knowledge, see what modifications I should make ..."

				  "The Two Cultures: A Second Look"

	"The academic mind is addicted to problems and averse to
solutions, since a problem is a nice little earner but a solution

			PIAZZA PIECE

	I am a gentleman in a dustcoat trying
	To make you hear. Your ears are soft and small
	And listen to an old man not at all,
	They want the young men's whispering and sighing.
	But see the roses on your trellis dying
	And hear the spectral singing of the moon;
	For I must have my lovely lady soon,
	I am a gentleman in a dustcoat trying.

	I am a lady young in beauty waiting
	Until my true love comes, and then we kiss.
	But what grey man among the vines is this
	Whose words are dry and faint as in a dream?
	Back from my trellis, Sir, before I scream!
	I am a lady young in beauty waiting.

        "For all my years, the only piece of wisdom I've acquired
          is that time doesn't have to move forward. The noblest

          way, and terminate in beauty and forgiveness."

* Abstinence from liquor is requested, but if you must drink share the
   bottle. To do otherwise makes you appear selfish and un-neighbourly.
* If a lady is present, gentlemen are urged to forgo smoking cigars and
   pipes as the odor of same may be repugnant to the gentler sex.
   Chewing tobacco is permitted but spit with the wind not against it.
* Buffalo robes are provided for your comfort during the cold weather.
   Hogging robes will not be tolerated and offenders will be made to 
   ride with the driver.
* Don't snore loudly or use your fellow passenger's shoulder for a 
   pillow. He (or she) may not understand and friction may result.
* Fire arms may be kept on your person for emergencies. Do not fire for
   pleasure or shoot at wild animals as the sound riles the horses.
* In the event of runaway horses remain calm. Leaping from the coach 
   will leave you injured, at the mercy of the elements, hostile 
   Indians & hungry coyotes.
* Forbidden topics of discussion are stage coach robbers and Indian 
   uprisings.
* Gentlemen guilty of unchivalrous behavior towards lady passengers 
   will be put off the stage. It is a long walk back.

      How do I go about writing a script? I sit down on a chair.
      I pull out a typewriter -- or computer now -- and just try to

      order. That's the only problem really.

      The role of the critic is to help people see what is in the work,
      what is in it that shouldn't be, what is not in it that could be.
      He is a good critic if he helps people understand more about the 
      work than they could see for themselves; he is a great critic,
      if by his understanding and feeling for the work, by his passion,
      he can excite people so that they want to experience more of the
      art that is there, waiting to be seized. He is not necessarily
      a bad critic if he makes errors in judgment (Infallible taste is
      inconceivable; what could it be measured against?) He is a bad
      critic if he does not awaken the curiosity, enlarge the interests
      and understanding of his audience. The art of the critic is to
      transmit his knowledge of and enthusiasm for art to others.

      ... theory distorts experience ... and helps us to see more
      sharply for having done so ...

     To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, 
      than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to 
      his amusement. This is not the sort of happiness
      which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife;
      but where other powers of entertainment are wanting,
      the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as
      are given.

     Q: The menu in our cafeteria shows that enchiladas are available 
        "Tue.-Fri." When I ordered one on a Wednesday, I was told that 
	enchiladas are available on Tuesday and Friday, not Tuesday 
	through Friday. When I informed the cafeteria manager that this
	sign was incorrect, she seemed shocked and refused to change
	the sign. Please help determine who is correct.
     A: Although the sign was incorrect, I'm not sure you should annoy
        the person who provides the enchiladas.

    "... this diversion, although pleasant, is not true. Things never
      happened thus."
    "Oh, but it is true. Things need not have happened to be true. Tales
      and dreams are the shadow-truths that will endure when mere facts are
      dust and ashes, and forgot."

    "You pigs, you. You rut like pigs, is all. You got the most in you, and
      you use the least. You hear me, you? Got a million in you and spend
      pennies. Got a genius in you and think crazies. Got a heart in you and
      feel empties. All a you. Every you ...
     Take a war to make you spend. Take a jam to make you think. Take a
      challenge to make you great. Rest of the time you sit around lazy, you.
      Pigs, you! All right, God damn you! I challenge you, me. Die or live
      and be great."

     "I believe," he thought. "I have faith."
     "Faith in what?" he asked himself, adrift in limbo.
     "Faith in faith," he answered himself. "It isin't necessary to have
       something to believe in. It's only necessary to believe that 
       somewhere there's something worthy of belief."

    It is the nature of idea to be communicated: written, spoke, done. The idea is
     like grass. It craves light, likes crowds, thrives on crossbreeding, likes
     being stepped on.

    As he hurried along, eagerly anticipating the moment when he would be at home
     again among the things he knew and liked, the Mole saw clearly that he was an
     animal of tilled field and hedgerow, linked to the ploughed furrow, the
     frequented pasture, the lane of evening lingerings, the cultivated garden
     plot. For others the asperities, the stubborn endurance, or the clash of actual
     conflict, that went with Nature in the rough; he must be wise, must keep to the
     pleasant places in which his lines were laid and which held adventure enough,
     in their way, to last for a lifetime.

                                 ...

    "And you, you will come too, young brother; for the days pass, and never return, 
      and the South still waits for you. Take the Adventure, heed the call, now ere 
      the irrevocable moment passes! 'Tis but a banging of the door behind you, a
      blithersome step forward, and you are out of the old life and into the new!
      Then someday, someday long hence, jog home here if you will, when the cup has
      been drained and the play has been played, and sit down by your quiet river with
      a store of goodly memories for company. You can easily overtake me on the road,
      for you are young and I am ageing and go softly. I will linger and look back; and 
      at last I will surely see you coming, eager and lighthearted, with all the South
      in your face."

                                 ...

     Indeed, much of what he related belonged more properly to the category of what-might-
      have-happened-had-I-only-thought-of-it-in-time-instead-of-ten-minutes-afterwards.
      Those are always the best and raciest adventures; and why should they not be truly 
      ours, as much as the somewhat inadequate things that really come off?

        - Kenneth Grahame, THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS

     Consider that everything is opinion, and opinion is in thy power. Take away then,
      when thou choosest, thy opinion, and like a mariner, who has doubled the
      promontory, thou wilt find calm, everything stable, and a waveless bay.

        - Marcus Aurelius, MEDITATIONS, Book 12, Part 22

    "Yeah, well, what do you know? You and your Ivory Tower, hurling down your
      Wisdom McNuggets dipped in the Special Sauce of the Establishment!"

        - Kristen Johnson, 3RD ROCK FROM THE SUN

    Given the right premises, any desired conclusion can be reached, automatic as
     addition. This is plain to most of mankind after a few years of experiment.
     Jumping to conclusions is an easy process, akin to cooking, which in fact it
     rivals in age. Pick your premises, follow the rules, and apple pie.
    Once men realized the danger in false conclusions, of course they instantly
     reformed themselves, and as everyone knows have ever since been far more
     sparing in the making of them. We should all be congratulated, but the job 
     is not yet done. Far more serious than jumping to conclusions is its 
     antecedent -- jumping to premises. The ideal man is not only sparing of
     conclusions, but also the premises to which he commits himself.

    My job is not to find out what the public wants and give it to them;

    Science has achieved some wonderful things of course, but I'd far rather
     be happy than right any day.

    Well, I mean, yes idealism, yes the dignity of pure research, yes the
     pursuit of truth in all its forms, but there comes a point I'm afraid
     where you begin to suspect that if there's any real truth, it's that the 
     entire multi-dimemsional infinity of the Universe is almost certainly 
     being run by a bunch of maniacs.

    It is so difficult to make a neat job of killing people with whom

    You and I have a tendency towards corpulence. Corpulence makes a man
     reasonable, pleasant, and phlegmatic. Have you noticed the nastiest of
     tyrants are invariably thin?

    Listen, Little Boy, in this business there's only one law you gotta follow

    In much wisdom there is much grief, and he who increases knowledge
      increases sorrow.

    The whole problem of the world is that fools and fanatics are always 
     so certain of themselves, but wiser people so full of doubts.

    Why create a work of art when dreaming about it is so much sweeter?

    If you're going to tell people the truth, be funny or they'll kill you.

        - Billy Wilder

    There is perhaps no beguilement more insidious and dangerous 
     than an elaborate and elegant mathematical process built upon
     unfortified premises.

        - Thomas Chamberlin

    There is something fascinating about science. One gets such wholesome
     return of conjecture out of such a trifiling investment of fact.

        - Mark Twain

    Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds wake
     in the day to find that all was vanity; but the dreamers of the day
     are dangerous men, for they may act their dream with open eyes, and 
     make it possible.

    The past, unavoidably, is commemorated to the extent that it serves
     the needs of the present.

    Sit down before fact as a little child, be prepared to give up every 
     preconceived notion, follow humbly wherever and to whatever abysses 
     nature leads, or you shall learn nothing.

    Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it 
     deeply enough.

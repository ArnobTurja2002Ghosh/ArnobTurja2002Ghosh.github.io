"One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got into my pajamas, I'll never know."
                                             -- Captain Spaulding (Groucho Marx). Animal Crackers.
Story behind this quote: 
In Fall 2021 I took Comp 1000 with Professor Todd Wareham. It was the time when I did not understand the point of programming languages.
I observed that the programming language is not a distinct language with its own alphabet - it was English language but not the way humans normally communicate in English.
"If we have to tell the computer what to do, why not say in the same way we instruct a human?" used to be my question.
In one of his classes Wareham, giving reference to the above quote, argued that human languages are confusing and can mean a lot of things; 
a human can still understand another human only based on contexts; hence there are programming languages. 
I loved the answer since it gave me an introduction to programming languages and an eagerness to master them - hence keeping the quote in my collection.

"To know your enemy, you must become your enemy."
                                   -- Sun Tzu
Story behind this quote:
Professor David Churchill taught us the strategy of best response in a game using the above quote.
I think this one quote sums up the concepts of mini-max and Nash equilibrium, which I also learned from Churchill.
